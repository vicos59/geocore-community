		information to get your Storefront set up and ready for use. Your Storefront provides an excellent means for you to highlight 
		your active listings and draw more customer attention. Your basic Storefront features and capabilities include:</p>

	<h3 class="subtitle">Step 1: Familiarization with your Storefront Control Panel</h3>
	<p style="padding: 0 15px; font-size: 0.8em;">Login to our site and access the <strong>Storefront Control Panel</strong> 
		in your <strong>My Account</strong> pages. The main page displays visitor statistics to your Storefront and also allows you
		to turn your Storefront "on" and "off." You can preview your Storefront as you make changes. If your Storefront is set to "off," 
		only you will be able to view it. You will also see a <strong>Control Menu</strong> which is the primary means for you to 
		manage your Storefront. Now, let's get started! </p>

	<h3 class="subtitle">Step 2: Customize </h3>
	<p style="padding: 0 15px; font-size: 0.8em;">The <strong>Customize</strong> page allows you to upload your logo which will be
		displayed in the header of your Storefront. So, upload your logo if you have one. If not, the system will place a temporary logo 
		until you have one. Preview your Storefront to verify that your logo is displaying properly. You can also adjust the height and
	width if you like. Although we have already optimized the page to display your logo correctly within the template. You can also add a
		<strong>Storefront Name</strong>, such as your business name, or business slogan. Next, you can add a <strong>Welcome Note</strong> 
	which is a short message that you can display at the top of each Storefront page. Lastly, select your theme. We have provided you 
	several options to choose from to help you customize your site a little further.</p>
	
	<h3 class="subtitle">Step 3: Categories &amp; Pages</h3>
	<p style="padding: 0 15px; font-size: 0.8em;">This page allows you to create the basic browsing pages and categories of your Storefront. 
		The <strong>Home Category Name</strong> will take your customers to the home page of your Storefront when clicked. Next, set up 
		your Storefront categories. Your Storefront will only display the categories you set up here. Add only categories and subcategories 
		to your Storefront that you plan to use when you place your listings. Once all of your categories are set up, you will see them as an
		additional selection during the normal listing process on our site. Lastly, add the <strong>Storefront Pages</strong> you wish
	to display. Storefront pages can be used to tell your customers a little more about yourself and your products and services.</p>

	<h3 class="subtitle">Step 4: Newsletter </h3>
	<p style="padding: 0 15px; font-size: 0.8em;">This page allows you to turn on the Newsletter function. This allows site visitors to 
	sign up as a newsletter subscriber to your Storefront. They will submit their email address to your list and you can then use the form 
	to send out a newsletter to your subscribers.</p>
