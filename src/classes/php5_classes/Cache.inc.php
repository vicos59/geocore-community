 * This is a proceedural file, designed to emulate including a cache file, no

 * been written to the file yet.

 * If it has been written to a file, it will actually include the file, so that
 * using this will be much more efficient than getting the contents and evaling
 * (which is required if that is not the case)
 *
 * @package System
 * @since Version 4.0.0 (previous versions used other methods to include cache files)
 * @return mixed Returns just like actually including the file would have
 *  returned, or false if there was a cache miss or error reading cache.
