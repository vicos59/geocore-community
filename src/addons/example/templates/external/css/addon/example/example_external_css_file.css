/*
 * This is an example CSS file.  It is for demonstration purposes only, to show
 * how an addon can add external files to default template set.
 *
 * If the folder templates/external/ exists in the addon, all folders and files
 * in that folder will be automatically copied to the default template set's external/
 * folder when the addon is installed or updated.  You could then reference the file
 * in your PHP file using something similar to:
 *
 * geoTemplate::getUrl('resource','file.ext')
 *
 * In template file:
 * {external file='resource/file.ext'}
 *
 * To get for this specific file, you would use:
 * PHP:
 * geoTemplate::getUrl('css','addon/example/example_external_css_file.css')
 * TPL:
 * {external file='css/addon/example/example_external_css_file.css'}
 *
 * It is highly recommended to put any files in sub-folder "addon/addon_name/" as
 * we did for this example file, to prevent file-name collisions.
 *
 * NOTE: The above also applies to the sub-folder templates/main_page/ - if that
 * folder exists in an addon, any contents will automatically be copied to default
 * template set's main_page/ folder upon installation or updating of the addon.
