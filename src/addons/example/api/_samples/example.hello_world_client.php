/**
 * This is a sample "hello world" stand-alone Remote API client script, that uses
 * the {@link hello_world.php}.
 *
 * Note: This is intended for people that are familiar with editing PHP files.
 *
 * Instructions for using this as a stand-alone API client:
 * 1.   Edit this file:  Look for the line that starts with "$xmlrpc_location".
 *      Change it to:
 *      $xmlrpc_location = "XMLRPC.class.php";
 * 2.   Set the rest of the "Required Settings" as needed (like $website, $api_key, etc)
 *      Each setting has it's own instructions right above it.
 *      There may be optional settings as well, those can be set by
 *      un-commenting them and set them as instructed.
 * 3.   Upload the modified file to a location that you can access from the web.
 *      It does not have to be on the same website as the Geo software.
 * 4.   Upload the file "XMLRPC.class.php" to the same location that you uploaded
 *      this file to.  The file is located in the Geo software at:
 *      classes/rpc/XMLRPC.class.php
 * 5.   In a web browser, visit the file you uploaded in step 3.  You should see
 *  the results of the API call.
