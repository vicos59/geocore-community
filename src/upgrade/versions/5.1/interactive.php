Hello!!!  This is an interactive portion of the update process.  Normally we would
ask some important question we need the answer to in order to do the update, but
this is just an example, so we're going to ask what is your favorite color.
<br /><br />
<form action="" method="post">
    <!-- If submitting, remember to have these hidden fields
        so that the update knows they have already gotten past
        the "requirement checking" stage.
     -->
    <input type="hidden" name="license" value="on" />
    <input type="hidden" name="backup_agree" value="on" />
    <input type="hidden" name="licenseKey" value="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_POST['licenseKey']); ?>" />
    <label>
        What is your favorite color in the rainbow? 
        <select name="favColor">
            <option>Red</option>
            <option>Orange</option>
            <option>Yellow</option>
            <option>Green</option>

Thank you for selecting your favorite color, <?php echo $_POST['favColor'];?>, 
that is my favorite color too!!  Proceeding with the update.
